# **NeurAI Explorer**

**NeurAI Explorer** is an advanced Python-based tool designed to dynamically adjust neural network architectures and hyperparameters based on the latest findings in machine learning research. The tool scrapes recent research papers from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), processes them using natural language processing (NLP), and incorporates new findings into neural network models automatically.

## **Features**
- **Web Scraping**: Automatically scrapes the latest machine learning papers from arXiv.
- **NLP-Based Analysis**: Analyzes the content of the papers using state-of-the-art NLP models.
- **Dynamic Model Building**: Adjusts neural network architectures and hyperparameters based on the extracted insights.
- **Automation**: Supports task automation through Celery, enabling scheduled updates of models.
- **Customizable**: Easily configurable for different machine learning subdomains (e.g., computer vision, NLP).

## **Requirements**

Before setting up the project, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.8+
- [`arxiv`](https://pypi.org/project/arxiv/) for fetching papers
- [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) for HTTP requests
- [`PyPDF2`](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) or [`pdfminer.six`](https://pypi.org/project/pdfminer.six/) for extracting text from PDFs
- [`spaCy`](https://spacy.io/) for NLP
- [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) for advanced text analysis
- [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/) or [`TensorFlow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for neural network modeling
- [`Celery`](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/) for task automation

Install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neurai-explorer.git
   cd neurai-explorer
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the required spaCy language model:**

   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

## **Usage**

### **1. Fetch recent research papers from arXiv:**

Run the script to fetch the latest research papers:

```bash
python main.py
```

### **2. Automate the process with Celery:**

Set up Celery to automate fetching, processing, and adapting models:

1. **Start the Celery worker:**

   ```bash
   celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info
   ```

2. **(Optional) Schedule periodic updates with Celery Beat:**

   You can configure `tasks.py` to run updates at regular intervals.

### **3. Customize Neural Network Model Building:**

To customize how neural networks are built based on paper content, modify the logic in `model_adaptation/build_model.py`. The model architecture adapts based on keywords extracted from the research papers.

### **4. Configure Categories and Parameters:**

You can modify the research category (e.g., computer vision, NLP) in the `data_acquisition/fetch_papers.py` file by adjusting the `category` parameter.
